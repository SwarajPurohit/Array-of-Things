# Array-of-Things

This project involves processing and visulaizing Array of Things data. Array of Things is an open source collaborative by the US government, some private firms and researchers. The project involves setting up Internet of Things (IOT) sensors across American cities to serve as a 'fitness tracking' infrastructure.<br />
The IOT engine is powered by a software and hardware platform known as Waggle which is developed by Argonne Labs. Use this link to get sensor details: https://github.com/waggle-sensor/sensors. The data used for this project is for the city of Chicago and is for the week 2nd to 10th february 2019. The data can be obtained from this link: https://aot-file-browser.plenar.io/data-sets/chicago-complete.
The data contains three files of interest - sensor information (sensors.csv), data captured (data.gz.csv) and node information (nodes.csv) are used.<br />
The project involves wrangling the data by cleaning the sensor data and multiple levels of aggregating it. The data is then visualized by creating a dashboard using shiny server in R. A univariate time series forecasting model is developed for predicting pollutant concentrations using tensorflow in R. The dashboard gives the past trends of various sensor parameters across various community areas, the current status of a parameter as shown on a choropleth map and the forecast given by the algorithm. Note that tensorflow requires an anaconda environment to be installed in R.
